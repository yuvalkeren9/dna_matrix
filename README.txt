Weâ€™ve developed a set of tools to help you easily interact with our API and solve various problems.
Additionally, we have created a special HTML file that beautifully displays this API, making it easier to navigate and understand the functionality.
Below is a summary of the files and their respective functionalities:

lookahead.py
This file contains the implementation of the lookahead algorithms, which are used for row problem-solving.

direct_solvers.py
Contains an algorithm we developed to solve the row problem using graph theory.

graphs.py
This file includes a collection of useful functions for creating and working with graphs, which are integral to various parts of the project.

balance_histogram.py
All functions related to the balance histogram algorithm are housed in this file.
